# Bayesian-Classification-and-Na-ve-Bayes-Classification
Part A: Bayesian Classification (Quadratic Multiclass Classification)

For this part of homework, you have to generate two datasets for three classes each with 500 samples from three Gaussian distribution for each dataset described below:

Dataset#1:

Dataset#2:

• Consider the first 80% of the data in each class for train and the rest 20% for test.

• Use a Bayesian classifier to classify both the train and test datasets and calculate both
accuracies (for each dataset separately).

• Plot the decision boundary and classification results while representing the misclassified samples with a different color or shape (for each dataset separately).

• Plot estimated PDFs. (3D for each dataset separately)

• Contour estimated PDFs along with the decision boundary. (2D for each dataset separately)

Part B: Naïve Bayes Classification

Dataset: Sentiment Labelled Sentences

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Sentiment+Labelled+Sentences

In this part you have to implement a Naive Bayes classifier to detect positive and negative sentiment from reviews. The “Sentiment Labelled Sentences” dataset is provided and you have to refer to the “readme” file so as to find out more about this dataset. this dataset contains sentences labelled with positive or negative sentiment, extracted from reviews of products, movies, and restaurants. The sentences come from three different websites: imdb.com, amazon.com, and yelp.com. For each website, there exist 500 positive and 500 negative sentences.
• Consider the first 80% of the data in each website review for train and the rest 20% of each website review for test. (for each website review separately)

• Classify the data using Naïve Bayes classifier and report the total and per-class accuracies (train and test for each website review separately).

• Use each word as a feature and construct a dictionary. (for each website review separately. So, you will have 3 dictionaries)
